### Description
This zip installs all the APKs and APKSs (zipped split apk bundles) in a directory to /data. It can be flashed through Magisk Manager. It supports all Android versions and it supports all architectures.

For support:
Provide Manager logs.

How to control the zip:

- The zip will install APKs from the first directory in which it finds APK files (in decreasing order of preference):
-- Inside the zip in "APKs" folder
-- [Zip's directory] (not if flashed through Magisk Manager)
-- internal-storage/MinInstaller

Thanks to @osm0sis for the base magisk/recovery code and inspiration and guidance on the majority of the stuff in here. You're awesome.
